Ever ordered food on UberEats and wondered where the driver was before receiving your order and how long it took to get to the restaurant or if your order was ready when the courier arrived? Ever wondered why your grocery delivery from Uber always has the best apple picked?\n  \n\n  \n\nIf so, Uber is for you. In our ML and Science division, we strive to make magic within Uber's marketplace. This requires judgment to make difficult trade\\-offs, blending algorithms with human resourcefulness, and the ability to build simplicity from complexity. When we get the balance right for everyone, Uber magic happens. We build systems to peer into the future to craft the most cost\\-efficient marketplace for matching supply and demand. We are passionate about using innovative economics, machine learning, and scalable distributed software that automates and optimizes every aspect of this intricate dance between participants of the marketplace.\n  \n\n  \n\nWe are involved in every stage of the product development cycle and use data to inform product decisions, build models to power our solutions, and also develop platform tools that are used across teams with a primary focus on Mobility and Delivery. We work with millions of earners across the globe to make this magic happen and want you to join us!\n  \n\n  \n\n**About the Team**  \n\n  \n\nEarners (drivers and couriers) are an integral part of Uber's multi\\-sided marketplace.

This presents the teams with the opportunity to shape and tailor the product experience during earners' many firsts (i.e., first time interacting on the Uber platform, choosing the earning opportunity, going online, receiving incentive offers, completing a trip, or reading the earnings summary). These firsts can be daunting.\n  \n\n  \n\nTherefore, making sure that the earner journey is great at every touch point is important to build trust with Earners, communicate Uber's value proposition, and ensure each firsts to be a great experience.\n  \n\n  \n\n**What the Candidate Will Do**\n* Build statistical, optimization, and machine learning models\n* Develop innovative new earner incentives that earners for choosing our network and optimizing Uber's new earner incentives spend\n* Optimize Uber's background check spend and onboarding funnel\n* Design recommendation engines to recommend the most relevant earning opportunities and early lifecycle content\n* Develop matching algorithms for driver to driver mentorship program\n* Model and predict earner behaviors to improve earner experience throughout the onboarding funnel\n* The team employs a variety of ML/AI techniques, spanning from causal ML meta learners, supervised ML, RL multi\\-armed bandits, genAI LLM to deep learning embeddings to build impactful data products.\n* Work closely with multi\\-functional leads to develop technical vision, new methodological approaches, and drive team direction.\n* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams such as product, engineering, operations, and marketing to drive ML system development end\\-to\\-end from conceptualization to final product.\n\n**Basic Qualifications**\n* PhD or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Operations Research, Statistics, or other related quantitative fields or related field\n* 4 years minimum of industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer/Research Scientist with a strong focus on deep learning and probabilistic modeling.\n* Proficiency in multiple object\\-oriented programming languages (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C\\+\\+).\n* Experience with any of the following: Spark, Hive, Kafka, Cassandra.\n* Experience building and productionizing innovative end\\-to\\-end Machine Learning systems.\n* Experience in exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and experimental design.\n* Experience working with cross\\-functional teams(product, science, product ops etc).\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n* 5\\+ years of industry experience in machine learning, including building and deploying ML models.\n* Publications at industry recognized ML conferences.\n* Experience in modern deep learning architectures and probabilistic modeling.\n* Experience with optimization techniques, including reinforcement learning (RL), Bayesian methods, causal ML meta learners, genAI LLM.\nExpertise in the design and architecture of ML systems and workflows.  \n* \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFor New York, NY\\-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$202,000 per year \\- USD$224,000 per year.

We’re a product\\-driven company that values clarity, speed, and high\\-quality execution.\n\n### **About the Role**\n\n\nWe’re hiring a Design Engineer to focus on building and maintaining high\\-quality, production\\-ready user interfaces. This role is primarily about execution: turning defined designs and requirements into clean, consistent, and reliable front\\-end code.\n\n\nWhile this is not a purely design role, we’re looking for someone who naturally notices UI issues during implementation—misaligned spacing, inconsistent styles, awkward interactions—and fixes them as part of delivering polished work. You’ll collaborate with designers and product managers, but your core responsibility is shipping solid UI.\n\n### **What You’ll Do**\n\n* Implement front\\-end features using React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.\n* Translate approved designs into accurate, maintainable UI.\n* Work within existing design systems and component libraries.\n* Ensure UI consistency across screens and features.\n* Address visual and usability issues encountered during development.\n* Build responsive, accessible, and performant interfaces.\n* Participate in code reviews and follow established front\\-end standards.\n\n### **What We’re Looking For**\n\n* 3–5 years of professional front\\-end development experience.\n* Strong, hands\\-on experience with React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.\n* Proven ability to implement designs faithfully and efficiently.\n* Comfort working within established UI patterns and constraints.\n* Strong attention to detail and pride in clean execution.\n* Experience collaborating with designers and product managers in a delivery\\-focused environment.\n* Working knowledge of responsive design and basic accessibility practices.\n\n### **Nice to Have**\n\n* Experience with component libraries or design systems (Ant Design, Storybook, or similar).\n* Background working on B2B or SaaS products.\n* Familiarity with reviewing designs in Figma.\n* Interest in front\\-end performance and UI reliability.\n* Exposure to product design workflows and UI/UX best practices, including collaborating in Figma before designs are finalized.\n\n### **Pay \\& Benefits**\n\n\nThe estimated annual base salary range for this role in the U.S. is **$100,000 – $135,000**, depending on experience, qualifications, and location.\n\n\nWe also offer a competitive benefits package, which may include: \\- 401(k) retirement plan with a 4% company match \\- Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance \\- Generous paid time off (PTO)\n\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who enjoys shipping dependable, well\\-built UI and wants to focus on execution over ownership of design direction.\n\nWe believe in rewarding talent and dedication with a **supportive, high\\-growth environment** and benefits that help you thrive—both personally and professionally.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nPBWmT5CYqT", "company_industry": NaN, "company_url": "https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Giftogram", "company_logo": NaN, "company_url_direct": "https://www.giftogram.com", "company_addresses": "Parsippany", "company_num_employees": "11 to 50", "company_revenue": NaN, "company_description": NaN, "skills": null, "experience_range": null, "company_rating": null, "company_reviews_count": null, "vacancy_count": null, "work_from_home_type": null}
